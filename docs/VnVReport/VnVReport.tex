\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Project Summary}

Sayyara is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) which acts as a single platform for independent auto
repair shops and vehicle owners. This platform allows independent auto repair shops and vehicle
owners to interact in various ways. Using Sayyara, vehicle owners can search for auto repair shops
and services based on a variety of search filters; request quotes for service; book, view, and
manage service appointments. On the application, auto repair shop owners have full shop management
capabilities such as: adding and managing a list of employees; managing a list of service types and
corresponding service appointment availabilities; managing store information such as location,
hours of operation, and contact information. Auto repair shop owners and employees will be able to
manage quotes, service appointments, and work orders from a single application.

\subsection{Purpose of Document}
This document outlines the validation and verification process for the application, Sayyara, and a
detailed summary of results for the planned tests defined in the
\href{https://github.com/arkinmodi/project-sayyara/blob/main/docs/VnVPlan/VnVPlan.pdf}{VnV Plan}.

\subsection{Scope of Testing}
As defined in the
\href{https://github.com/arkinmodi/project-sayyara/blob/main/docs/VnVPlan/VnVPlan.pdf}{VnV Plan},
the tests reported aim to verify and validate functional and nonfunctional requirements listed in
the \href{https://github.com/arkinmodi/project-sayyara/blob/main/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}{SRS}.

In addition, the testing reported in this document aims to validate that the application provides
adequate usability and to verify that system is in a functional state for the end users. The
testing and validation will aid in ensuring that the product fulfills the system requirements,
intended use, and goals of stakeholders.

\section{Changes Due to Testing}

During testing there were a few changes that were needed to be made to bring the application into
alignment with the requirements defined in the SRS and the plan defined in the VnV Plan. Test cases
``NFRT-OE-1'' and ``NFRT-SR2-1'' have failed and changes will be made to address them.
Additionally, there were comments made regarding the lack of the ability to edit and cancel
appointments in the user interface during the Revision 0 Demonstration. This feedback will also be
addressed. All changes are planned to be completed before the Revision 1 Demonstration.

\section{Automated Testing}

All automated testing was carried out by Jest, a JavaScript testing framework. Each module has its
own corresponding test file located within the ``test'' folder. The ``test'' folder has the same
structure as the ``src'' folder, creating a one-to-one mapping of a module and its corresponding
test. For example, the module ``src/server/services/userService.ts'' has its tests located in
``test/server/services/userService.test.ts''. There are two Jest test runs, with the only
difference being whether the testing environment is connected to a real database or not (i.e.,
whether the database needs to be seeded or mocked in each test case). As part of the CI/CD
pipeline, the full test suite is run and information regarding pass/fail and code coverage is
reported on every pull request to the main branch and to every push to the main branch.

\section{Code Coverage Metrics}

Code coverage was calculated using Jest's built-in code coverage instrumentation. A tool by the
name of ``nyc'' was used to merge the code coverage reports generated from the multiple runs and
output a human-readable HTML report. The code coverage report is documented in Table \ref{Code
	Coverage Report}. Code that was not checked by the automated testing was either tested manually or
outside the scope of the requirements.

\section{Appendix}

\subsection{Usability Survey Results} \label{Usability Survey Results}

The following are the results of the usability survey. Four people were interviewed as CUSTOMER
users, and several mechanics were interviewed as SHOP OWNER and EMPLOYEE users. The following were
the main points brought out through user testing

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Were there any bugs or issues you ran into?

	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Screen resizing issues when changing screen window size
		      \item Scrolling while in a dropdown would move the dropdown unexpectedly
	      \end{itemize}

	\item What did you like the most or what stood out for you while using the application?

	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Colour scheme is good
		      \item The website works in dark mode
	      \end{itemize}

	\item Please share what changes you'd like to see on our website.

	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Change the multiselect for parts into radio buttons, as they are confusing
		      \item Customers may not know what OEM or AFTERMARKET stands for, clarification would be helpful
		      \item Make the logo at the top left more reactive (let the mouse turn into a clickable icon to tell the
		            user you can click on the logo)
		      \item The logo seems a bit unrefined. A more professional logo would be nice
		      \item The email address and phone numbers for each shop profile should allow customers to immediately
		            navigate to them (either an email or phone call)
		      \item There are few car companies to choose from
	      \end{itemize}

	\item Was the website intuitive, easy to learn to use and navigate?

	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item The website could be more clean, there are many steps need to reach tasks such as booking an
		            appointment
		      \item The route between booking a canned appointment and a custom appointment was slightly confusing,
		            there is no way to create a quote from the chat page
	      \end{itemize}

	\item When you made a mistake while navigating or using the application, was it easy to recover?

	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item The website crashed once, and I was given a critical warning where I had to refresh the page to
		            recover
	      \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the graduate attribute
of Reflection. Please answer the following question:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different from the activities that were
	      actually conducted for VnV? If there were differences, what changes required the modification in
	      the plan? Why did these changes occur? Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
	      projects? If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly predict a feasible
	      amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the evidence that demonstrates the required
	      quality? (It is expected that most teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
\end{enumerate}
