\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing software. A module
is a work assignment for a programmer or programming team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. We advocate a
decomposition based on the principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}. This principle
supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module hides represent likely future
changes. Design for change is valuable in SC, where modifications are frequent, especially during
initial development as the solution space is explored.

Our design follows the rules layed out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the secrets of separate modules.
	\item Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
	\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data structures must obtain it by
	      calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements Specification (SRS), the
Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG specifies the modular structure of
the system and is intended to allow both designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of
the software. The potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member to easily understand the
	      overall structure and quickly find the relevant modules they are searching for.
	\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the maintainers' understanding
	      when they need to make changes to the system. It is important for a maintainer to update the
	      relevant sections of the document after changes have been made.
	\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to check for consistency,
	      feasibility, and flexibility. Designers can verify the system in various ways, such as consistency
	      among modules, feasibility of the decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section \ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and
unlikely changes of the software requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module
decomposition that was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the modules. Section \ref{SecMD}
gives a detailed description of the modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability
matrices. One checks the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS.
The other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section \ref{SecUse}
describes the use relation between modules.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness of the change, the
possible changes are classified into two categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section
\ref{SecAchange}, and unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden inside the modules.
Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only require changing the one module that
hides the associated decision. The approach adapted here is called design for change.

\begin{description}
	\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acHardware}:] The specific
		hardware on which the software is running.
	\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acInput}:] The format of the
		initial input data.
	\item ...
\end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is more complex.
Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design decisions at the system architecture
stage can simplify the software design. If these decision should later need to be changed, then
many parts of the design will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.

\begin{description}

		(Input: File and/or Keyboard, Output: File, Memory, and/or Screen).
	\item ...
\end{description}

\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized in a hierarchy
decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TblMH}. The modules listed below, which are leaves in the
hierarchy tree, are the modules that will actually be implemented.

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in the SRS. In this
stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection between requirements and modules is
listed in Table~\ref{TblRT}.

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding'' proposed by
\citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module decomposition is a brief statement of
the design decision hidden by the module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the
module will do without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the entry is \emph{OS},
this means that the module is provided by the operating system or by standard programming language
libraries. \emph{\progname{}} means the module will be implemented by the \progname{} software.

Only the leaf modules in the hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash (\emph{--}) is shown, this
means that the module is not a leaf and will not have to be implemented.

\subsection{Hardware Hiding Modules (\mref{mHH})}

\begin{description}
	\item[Secrets:]The data structure and algorithm used to implement the virtual hardware.
	\item[Services:]Serves as a virtual hardware used by the rest of the system. This module provides the
	interface between the hardware and the software. So, the system can use it to display outputs or to
	accept inputs.
	\item[Implemented By:] OS
\end{description}

\subsection{Behaviour-Hiding Module}

\begin{description}
	\item[Secrets:]The contents of the required behaviours.
	\item[Services:]Includes programs that provide externally visible behaviour of the system as specified in
	the software requirements specification (SRS) documents. This module serves as a communication
	layer between the hardware-hiding module and the software decision module. The programs in this
	module will need to change if there are changes in the SRS.
	\item[Implemented By:] --
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Input Format Module (\mref{mInput})}

\begin{description}
	\item[Secrets:]The format and structure of the input data.
	\item[Services:]Converts the input data into the data structure used by the input parameters module.
	\item[Implemented By:] [Your Program Name Here]
	\item[Type of Module:] [Record, Library, Abstract Object, or Abstract Data Type] [Information to include
		for leaf modules in the decomposition by secrets tree.]
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Etc.}

\subsection{Software Decision Module}

\begin{description}
	\item[Secrets:] The design decision based on mathematical theorems, physical facts, or programming
		considerations. The secrets of this module are \emph{not} described in the SRS.
	\item[Services:] Includes data structure and algorithms used in the system that do not provide direct
		interaction with the user.
		% Changes in these modules are more likely to be motivated by a desire to
		% improve performance than by externally imposed changes.
	\item[Implemented By:] --

\section{Traceability Matrix} \label{SecTM}

This section shows two traceability matrices: between the modules and the requirements and between
the modules and the anticipated changes.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is provided. \citet{Parnas1978} said of two
programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete
the task described in its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which
the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct implementation of B. Figure
\ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a
directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of
the system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler because they
use modules from the lower levels.
