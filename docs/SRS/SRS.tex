This document describes the requirements for Sayyara. The template for the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere template~\citep{RobertsonAndRobertson2012}. This
template has been modified to include personas to represent different user types. It has also been
modified to add formal specifications.

\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}

Independent auto repair shops do not have an efficient way of reaching and interacting with new
customers. Currently, many independent shop owners rely on word-of-mouth referrals as a main
channel to acquiring new customers. Independent auto repair shops are also spending a significant
amount of their time on administrative work such as managing appointments and providing quotes. As
a result, independent auto repair shops have a difficult time competing with larger repair shops
which have dedicated systems and services in place.

On the other hand, customers do not have an effective way to find and compare auto repair shops.
Currently, one of the only ways to compare repair shops is by manually searching or reaching out to
repair shops one-by-one. This process can often be repetitive and time-consuming.

Sayyara is a progressive web application (PWA) which will act as a single platform for independent
auto repair shops and vehicle owners. This platform will allow independent auto repair shops and
vehicle owners to interact in a more efficient and effective manner. Vehicle owners can search for
auto repair shops and services based on a variety of search filters; request quotes for service;
book, view, and manage service appointments. On the application, auto repair shop owners will have
full shop management capabilities such as: adding and managing a list of employees; managing a list
of service types and corresponding service appointment availabilities; managing store information
such as location, hours of operation, and contact information. Auto repair shop owners and
employees will be able to manage quotes, service appointments, and work orders from a single
application. Ultimately, Sayyara will significantly improve the auto repair experience for both
independent auto repair shops and vehicle owners.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}
The client of the project is Nabeel Ibrahim. Nabeel will be the point of contact throughout the
development of the project.

\subsubsection{The Customers}
The customers of Sayyara will be independent auto repair shop owners, shop employees, and vehicle
owners who are looking for a vehicle repair or maintenance service.

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
Other stakeholders of the project are the developers, Tiny Coders, who are designing and
implementing the project.

\subsection{Personas}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Albert Lee is a 25 year old professional working in the accounting industry from Markham, Ontario.
	      He has a wife and three children. Mr. Lee's family two cars: a silver 2005 Toyota Prius LE and a
	      black 2014 Honda CRV. He commutes to Vaughan, Ontario for work. On his way to work each morning, he
	      drops off his children at school. He prefers to drive the Prius for his work commute to save on
	      gas. However, on weekend road trips, grocery shopping, and driving his kids to soccer practice, he
	      prefers to drive the CRV. This is because the car is more spacious and can fit more cargo. Albert
	      has a busy schedule, but he is adamant in making sure his cars are regularly maintained. This is
	      because he believes that safety is important, and keeping his vehicles well-maintained will allow
	      his vehicles to have a longer useful-life. Albert is also very cost-conscious and likes to make
	      sure that he is getting the best value for anything he pays for.
	\item David Jones is a 60 year old independent auto repair shop owner in Hamilton, Ontario. He has been
	      operating his repair shop for over 35 years. David currently has 3 employees working for him: one
	      receptionist, and one mechanic, and one apprentice. David splits his time working on administrative
	      tasks, servicing cars, and overlooking the work of his employees. He is a very organized individual
	      and expects the same from his employees. David also believes that customer service is very
	      important, and only by providing the best value and service, can he compete with larger auto repair
	      and maintenance franchises.
	\item Alice Stark is a 22 year old Uber driver. She enjoys working for the platform due to the flexible
	      schedule. Alice drives a 2016 Chevy Cruze. On Uber, she delivers food and provides rides to
	      passengers. The service she offers depends on the time of day. During lunch and dinner hours, she
	      prefers to deliver food through Uber Eats due to the higher volume of orders. She also loves
	      interacting with people and customers, and hearing about their unique life stories. When she is not
	      working, she enjoys spending her time meeting her friends at restaurants, hiking, and playing
	      sports. Her car is very important to her, and it is an important part of her everyday. When she
	      needs auto repairs or maintenance, she likes to find high quality services which use OEM parts. She
	      does not mind paying more for quality work and parts because of how important her car is in her
	      daily life. However, since she has a very busy day and her work depends on her car, she also cares
	      about the service speed. It is important that her car can be repaired and fixed promptly.
	\item Alex Snow is a 42 year old auto repair mechanic working at a local repair shop in Burlington,
	      Ontario. Alex graduated as a mechanical engineer from the University of Waterloo 20 years ago.
	      Since graduating, he decided to dedicate his time to his passion of fixing cars. He likes to
	      maximize his time working on cars. Alex takes a lot of pride in his work, and wants to ensure that
	      each customer is satisfied with his work. Alex specializes in more advance repairs such as changing
	      transmissions, engine replacements, replacing cylinder blocks, and much more. He rarely spends time
	      on simpler services such as oil changes, brake replacement, and tire changes. These are the most
	      common repairs the shops sees, but are usually delegated to less experienced employees in the shop.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}

There are currently no known open issues that may lead to significant change to the product or its
design.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}

\subsubsection{Ready-Made Products}

There are existing services that solve many of the problems that this application aims to address.
These include AutoLeap (https://autoleap.com), Sayaaraa (https://sayaaraa.com), and KUKUI
(https://www.kukui.com). These are all paid services and most offer a trial period. Additional,
these app only address the shop management aspect of the problem. Openbay (https://app.openbay.com)
is an existing application that focuses on vehicle owner's needs. This application exclusively
operates in the United States of America.

\subsubsection{Resuable Components}

There are many libraries and frameworks available that can be reused to accelerate the building
process of the application. Next.js can be used to provide a framework to build the application.
Next.js comes with many out-of-box solutions for common website development problems. NextAuth.js
is a library designed to help simplify the authentication process. Prisma is a library designed to
help simplify the communication between the application and the database. Next-PWA is a library
designed to quickly bootstrap a Next.js application into a progressive web application.

A runtime and ecosystem that is available to use is Node.js. This runtime comes with a large
ecosystem of packages that can be reused and leveraged for common application components, including
the libraries listed previously.

All components listed above are free to use for private and commercial use.

\subsubsection{Products That Can Be Copied}

There are no known products available that can be legally copied for use in this application.

\subsection{New Problems}

\subsubsection{Effects on the Current Environment}

This application will change the way certain processes are preformed and these changes will impact
the users.

\textbf{Work Orders}

The work order system will affect the way automotive mechanics document their work. The data will
be inputted into the application therefore any failures can result in data loss.

\textbf{Appointments}

The appointments system will affect the way that both the customers and the employees schedule
appointments. The application will track daily appointment schedules and report time conflicts. The
application shall not lock the employee out of overriding the schedule.

\textbf{Quotes}

The quotes system will affect the way that both the customers and automotive repair shops
communicate in the service quotation process. The quotes will now be communicated partially or
completely through the application instead of completely in-person. Failure in this system may lead
to a loss in data.

\subsubsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}

The application will be completely stand alone and will not be interfacing with any existing
systems. The existing system may continue to coexist with the application at the user's discretion.

\subsubsection{Potential User Problems}

Any potential adverse reactions related to using the device in which application is being launched
on (e.g., computer, mobile device, tablet, etc.) would extend to the use of this application. The
application will not introduce any new adverse reactions to the user.

\subsubsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May Inhibit the New Product}

The database is not able to sustain the number of connections to serve all requests.

\subsubsection{Follow-Up Problems}

Any failures or downtime of third-party integrations may impact the overall availability and
operation of the application. These integrations include the database service provider, the email
server, and websocket provider. Additionally, this application will be dealing with user data. As
privacy laws around the world are getting stricter, there is a possibility application violates
these future laws that do not currently exist.

\subsection{Tasks}
\subsubsection{Project Planning}
The project schedule will follow the deadline for the deliverables outlined in the SFWRENG 4G06
course outline.

\begin{table}[H]

		\hline
	\end{tabular}

	\label{project_tasks}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Planning of the Development Phases}

The development of the project will be conducted in two phases:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Initial development of application and documentation
	\item Refinement of application and documentation
\end{enumerate}

Phase 1 is where the bulk of the application will be designed and implemented. The design of both
the components of the application and how the components will interact will de developed.
Additional, Phase 1 is where most of the documentation and report will be written. Phase 1 will end
with the Revision 0 Demonstration. Here the stakeholders will see the application implementation
and be able to provide feedback.

Phase 2 will be focused on refining the application and the documentation. There is expected to be
no new major feature development and instead, all efforts will be focused on incorporating the
stakeholders' feedback into the application.

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
\subsubsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}

There are no requirements for migrating to the new product.

\subsubsection{Data That Has to Be Modified or Translated for the New System}

No data needs to be modified or translated to the new system.

\subsection{Risks}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Failures in the work orders and quotes workflow may lead to data loss.
	\item Failures in the appointments workflow may lead to a loss in appointment or conflicting
	      appointments.
	\item Failure to meet deadlines will cause setbacks in project's timeline. In the event of this, lower
	      priority requirements may need to be dropped.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Costs}

There are no financial costs associated with the development of this application. All software and
cloud infrastructure used are free to use. There will be about six months of development time
required.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
\subsubsection{User Documentation Requirements}

The application will feature a ``Getting Started'' guide, where it shall guide the user through the
most common use cases. For vehicle owners, the use cases will include: searching for shops,
requesting quotes, and scheduling appointments. For automotive shops, the use cases include:
setting shop details, managing appointments, managing employees, responding to quotes, and managing
work orders.

\subsubsection{Training Requirements}

Knowledge of how to navigate a website will be required. Documentation concerning detailed usage of
the website's user flows will be provided to the user.

\subsection{Waiting Room}

There are currently no requirements that are not part of the initial release.

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}

During the requirements collection and understanding phase, there were also ideas on how to
implement the solution.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Form
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item With the constraint that this application to be a PWA, the idea of using a React-based framework,
		            specifically Next.js.
	      \end{itemize}
	\item Authentication
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item To handle authentication, using emails and passwords, with the package NextAuth.js.
		      \item Creating a dedicated endpoint in the backend for looking up user information.
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Appendix}

% This section has been added to the Volere template. This is where you can place additional
% information.

\subsection{Reflection}

\textbf{The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the graduate attribute
	of Lifelong Learning. Please answer the following questions:}

\begin{enumerate}[\textbf{\arabic*.}]
	\item \textbf{What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to successfully complete this
		      capstone project? Examples of possible knowledge to acquire include domain specific knowledge from
		      the domain of your application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
		      computer science knowledge. Skills may be related to technology, or writing, or presentation, or
		      team management, etc. You should look to identify at least one item for each team member.}

	      The team members will need to collectively acquire a set of unique skills to complete and succeed
	      in this capstone project. Some skills and knowledge outlined below are critical not only for the
	      delivery of the course deliverables and project milestones, but also in the individual team
	      member's success moving forward in their software engineering careers. Some skills and knowledge
	      will be necessary specifically for the implementation, development, and deployment of application.
	      \begin{enumerate}[\arabic*.]
		      \item Domain knowledge and skills specific to the development and deployment of PWAs
		      \item Writing and documentation in software engineering processes and software lifecycle
		      \item Presentation skills relevant for the McMaster Software Engineering Capstone Expo
		      \item Testing of PWAs and related technologies to be used in this project
		      \item Team management including time management, work distribution, and collaboration
		      \item Communication skills with key stakeholders
		      \item Statefully managing front-end components
		      \item Framework specific knowledge such as Next.js, React
	      \end{enumerate}

	\item \textbf{For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous question, what are at least
		      two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or mastering the skill? Of the identified approaches,
		      which will each team member pursue, and why did they make this choice?}

	      For acquiring the relevant skills, the team members will reference various resources available such
	      as course and educational content, online resource, industry resources and papers. For
	      technology-specific domain knowledge and skills, team members can refer to online resources such as
	      reading official documentation (for e.g., published by React, Next.js, etc.), YouTube tutorials,
	      and various other tutorials. For soft skills such as communication, time management, and
	      presentation skills, team members can leverage LinkedIn Learning as a platform for educational
	      courses in these areas. Team members can also take advantage of workshops and resources provided by
	      McMaster University. For writing skills and documentation, team members can refer to past examples
	      provided by the course, past coursework, online resources, and course material. All the above
	      skills can also be developed through hands-on experience throughout the course of the capstone
	      project.

	      Listed below under each team member's name is a list of skills which the team member will focus on
	      for the duration of this project.

	      \textbf{Arkin Modi}

	      Chosen Skills: 2., 4., 5., 6., 8.

	      Soft skills are important for any project, and are something that is continually improved upon.
	      This is why Arkin has identified 5 and 6 as skill he would like to focus on. Documentation is a
	      large portion of the capstone project and with Arkin having taken a year off for co-op, reviewing
	      the details on how to write the reports will prove to be a valuable skill. Technical skills 4 and
	      5, were chosen based on areas of interest. Testing and taking advantage of built-in framework tools
	      are going proving important in completing the capstone in a complete and progressional manner.
	      These are Arkin's reasons for choosing these skills to focus on improving.

	      For soft team skills (5 and 6), Arkin will be utilizing YouTube tutorials and online articles.
	      These were chosen due to Arkin's familiarity with learning in a destructured and focused style.
	      These approaches allow for solving problem directly faced in the capstone. For technical writing
	      (2), Arkin will refer to past work from previously taken courses. As the capstone is a culmination
	      of the program, past course work is highly relevant. Arkin will also reference online articles
	      discussing best practices and industry standards for documentation. For technical skills (4 and 8),
	      Arkin will rely on learning from YouTube tutorials and official documentation. This approach is
	      based on experience as this is how Arkin has started learn the majority of his development skills.
	      These are approaches Arkin will use and his rational on why.

	      \textbf{Joy Xiao}

	      Chosen Skills: 2., 3., 4., 5., 7.

	      I chose these parts because I think it would be very important for our project. Writing and
	      Documentation is very important because a lot of our deliverables are writing documents. I will
	      also need to work on my presentation skills for the capstone expo. I will also have to learn how to
	      do testing on PWAs and for the front end. This can be done through looking at online resources such
	      as youtube videos and looking at online resources such as StackOverflow. I will learn testing
	      skills through watching some youtube videos. After trying to test by myself I will consult
	      StackOverflow if I run into any issues. Communication is very important also especially
	      communicating with the stakeholders of the project. I will also be learning Next.js and React for
	      this project and will learn this through watching online tutorials and doing React online lessons.
	      I will choose doing lessons to learn React because it is less time consuming than finding and
	      watching tutorials. Online lessons will also have more hands on work to help me learn React.

	      \textbf{Leon So}

	      Chosen Skills: 1., 2., 3., 5., 8.

	      Leon has chosen to improve and develop skills related to the technologies used such as PWAs and
	      Next.js, because these skills are crucial to the success of the project. These skills will also be
	      useful for future industry work experiences. He has also chosen to improve on documentation and
	      writing skills as this is again an important skill to have in industry. This skill be highly
	      applicable to the project and capstone deliverables. Leon also chose to improve on presentation
	      skills because this has been a self-identified weakness which he has continually worked on
	      improving. Leon will take this opportunity to further improve on presentation skills in preparation
	      for the expo. This skill will also help him success in his later career. All the above skills were
	      chosen strategically, to not only improve on the skills necessary to succeed in this project, but
	      also for personal and professional growth and development.

	      To gain domain specific knowledge related to PWAs, Next.js, and other relevant technologies, Leon
	      will refer to official documentation, online resources, and tutorials. These approaches align well
	      with methods to gain knowledge and skills in industry. For documentation, Leon will refer to course
	      material and industry standards. This will ensure that the documentation Leon produces will meet
	      the standards and expectations of the industry and educational system. To improve on presentation
	      skills, communication skills, team management skills, and time management skills, Leon will
	      leverage LinkedIn Learning as a platform to gain knowledge in this area. LinkedIn Learning is a
	      great platform to learn such skills as many courses provide exercises and quizzes to reinforce
	      learning. LinkedIn Learning also has a wide selection of resources and material, many of which is
	      developed by professionals in the relevant fields.

	      \textbf{Timothy Choy}

	      Chosen Skills: 2., 5., 6., 7., 8.

	      Timothy will focus his efforts on non-technical skills such as team management and communication,
	      as well as technical skills such as writing and documentation, statefully managing front-end
	      components, and learning framework-specific knowledge. Timothy believes that the soft skills are
	      universally beneficial for his professional career, regardless of what software he decides to
	      create. Regarding the technical skills, Timothy would like to expand his front-end toolbox to be
	      able to more effectively create and build applications. Next.js and stateful React will be
	      important tools that will complement what Timothy already knows.

	      The approach that Timothy will take for developing his soft skills will be through working on the
	      current course work, and taking up positions in the the team that will allow him to improve on his
	      leadership and management skills. Timothy believes that his best method of learning and growth is
	      through action, and he will not hesitate to take this opportunity during this capstone. He will
	      also complement learning through the capstone with other managerial courses taken this semester
	      (the Engineering and Management capstone). The approach that Timothy will take for developing his
	      technical skills will be through reading official documentation and informational videos, usually
	      through Youtube. This choice was made because Timothy learns best through looking at examples and
	      finding ways to apply these examples in his own code.
