This document describes the requirements for Sayyara. The template for the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere template~\citep{RobertsonAndRobertson2012}. This
template has been modified to include personas to represent different user types.

\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}

Independent auto repair shops do not have an efficient way of reaching and interacting with new
customers. Currently, many independent shop owners rely on word-of-mouth referrals as a main
channel to acquiring new customers. Independent auto repair shops are also spending a significant
amount of their time on administrative work such as managing appointments and providing quotes. As
a result, independent auto repair shops have a difficult time competing with larger repair shops
which have dedicated systems and services in place.

On the other hand, customers do not have an effective way to find and compare auto repair shops.
Currently, one of the only ways to compare repair shops is by manually searching or reaching out to
repair shops one-by-one. This process can often be repetitive and time-consuming.

Sayyara is a progressive web application (PWA) which will act as a single platform for independent
auto repair shops and vehicle owners. This platform will allow independent auto repair shops and
vehicle owners to interact in a more efficient and effective manner. Vehicle owners can search for
auto repair shops and services based on a variety of search filters; request quotes for service;
book, view, and manage service appointments. On the application, auto repair shop owners will have
full shop management capabilities such as: adding and managing a list of employees; managing a list
of service types and corresponding service appointment availabilities; managing store information
such as location, hours of operation, and contact information. Auto repair shop owners and
employees will be able to manage quotes, service appointments, and work orders from a single
application. Ultimately, Sayyara will significantly improve the auto repair experience for both
independent auto repair shops and vehicle owners.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}
The client of the project is Nabeel Ibrahim. Nabeel will be the point of contact throughout the
development of the project.

\subsubsection{The Customers}
The customers of Sayyara will be independent auto repair shop owners, shop employees, and vehicle
owners who are looking for a vehicle repair or maintenance service.

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
Other stakeholders of the project are the developers, Tiny Coders, who are designing and
implementing the project.

\subsection{Personas}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Albert Lee is a 25 year old professional working in the accounting industry from Markham, Ontario.
	      He has a wife and three children. Mr. Lee's family two cars: a silver 2005 Toyota Prius LE and a
	      black 2014 Honda CRV. He commutes to Vaughan, Ontario for work. On his way to work each morning, he
	      drops off his children at school. He prefers to drive the Prius for his work commute to save on
	      gas. However, on weekend road trips, grocery shopping, and driving his kids to soccer practice, he
	      prefers to drive the CRV. This is because the car is more spacious and can fit more cargo. Albert
	      has a busy schedule, but he is adamant in making sure his cars are regularly maintained. This is
	      because he believes that safety is important, and keeping his vehicles well-maintained will allow
	      his vehicles to have a longer useful-life. Albert is also very cost-conscious and likes to make
	      sure that he is getting the best value for anything he pays for.
	\item David Jones is a 60 year old independent auto repair shop owner in Hamilton, Ontario. He has been
	      operating his repair shop for over 35 years. David currently has 3 employees working for him: one
	      receptionist, and one mechanic, and one apprentice. David splits his time working on administrative
	      tasks, servicing cars, and overlooking the work of his employees. He is a very organized individual
	      and expects the same from his employees. David also believes that customer service is very
	      important, and only by providing the best value and service, can he compete with larger auto repair
	      and maintenance franchises.
	\item Alice Stark is a 22 year old Uber driver. She enjoys working for the platform due to the flexible
	      schedule. Alice drives a 2016 Chevy Cruze. On Uber, she delivers food and provides rides to
	      passengers. The service she offers depends on the time of day. During lunch and dinner hours, she
	      prefers to deliver food through Uber Eats due to the higher volume of orders. She also loves
	      interacting with people and customers, and hearing about their unique life stories. When she is not
	      working, she enjoys spending her time meeting her friends at restaurants, hiking, and playing
	      sports. Her car is very important to her, and it is an important part of her everyday. When she
	      needs auto repairs or maintenance, she likes to find high quality services which use OEM parts. She
	      does not mind paying more for quality work and parts because of how important her car is in her
	      daily life. However, since she has a very busy day and her work depends on her car, she also cares
	      about the service speed. It is important that her car can be repaired and fixed promptly.
	\item Alex Snow is a 42 year old auto repair mechanic working at a local repair shop in Burlington,
	      Ontario. Alex graduated as a mechanical engineer from the University of Waterloo 20 years ago.
	      Since graduating, he decided to dedicate his time to his passion of fixing cars. He likes to
	      maximize his time working on cars. Alex takes a lot of pride in his work, and wants to ensure that
	      each customer is satisfied with his work. Alex specializes in more advance repairs such as changing
	      transmissions, engine replacements, replacing cylinder blocks, and much more. He rarely spends time
	      on simpler services such as oil changes, brake replacement, and tire changes. These are the most
	      common repairs the shops sees, but are usually delegated to less experienced employees in the shop.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}

There are currently no known open issues that may lead to significant change to the product or its
design.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}

\subsubsection{Ready-Made Products}

There are existing services that solve many of the problems that this application aims to address.
These include AutoLeap (https://autoleap.com), Sayaaraa (https://sayaaraa.com), and KUKUI
(https://www.kukui.com). These are all paid services and most offer a trial period. Additional,
these app only address the shop management aspect of the problem. Openbay (https://app.openbay.com)
is an existing application that focuses on vehicle owner's needs. This application exclusively
operates in the United States of America.

\subsubsection{Resuable Components}

There are many libraries and frameworks available that can be reused to accelerate the building
process of the application. Next.js can be used to provide a framework to build the application.
Next.js comes with many out-of-box solutions for common website development problems. NextAuth.js
is a library designed to help simplify the authentication process. Prisma is a library designed to
help simplify the communication between the application and the database. Next-PWA is a library
designed to quickly bootstrap a Next.js application into a progressive web application.

A runtime and ecosystem that is available to use is Node.js. This runtime comes with a large
ecosystem of packages that can be reused and leveraged for common application components, including
the libraries listed previously.

All components listed above are free to use for private and commercial use.

\subsubsection{Products That Can Be Copied}

There are no known products available that can be legally copied for use in this application.

\subsection{New Problems}

\subsubsection{Effects on the Current Environment}

This application will change the way certain processes are preformed and these changes will impact
the users.

\textbf{Work Orders}

The work order system will affect the way automotive mechanics document their work. The data will
be inputted into the application therefore any failures can result in data loss.

\textbf{Appointments}

The appointments system will affect the way that both the customers and the employees schedule
appointments. The application will track daily appointment schedules and report time conflicts. The
application shall not lock the employee out of overriding the schedule.

\textbf{Quotes}

The quotes system will affect the way that both the customers and automotive repair shops
communicate in the service quotation process. The quotes will now be communicated partially or
completely through the application instead of completely in-person. Failure in this system may lead
to a loss in data.

\subsubsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}

The application will be completely stand alone and will not be interfacing with any existing
systems. The existing system may continue to coexist with the application at the user's discretion.

\subsubsection{Potential User Problems}

Any potential adverse reactions related to using the device in which application is being launched
on (e.g., computer, mobile device, tablet, etc.) would extend to the use of this application. The
application will not introduce any new adverse reactions to the user.

\subsubsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May Inhibit the New Product}

The database is not able to sustain the number of connections to serve all requests.

\subsubsection{Follow-Up Problems}

Any failures or downtime of third-party integrations may impact the overall availability and
operation of the application. These integrations include the database service provider, the email
server, and websocket provider. Additionally, this application will be dealing with user data. As
privacy laws around the world are getting stricter, there is a possibility application violates
these future laws that do not currently exist.

\subsection{Tasks}
\subsubsection{Project Planning}
The project schedule will follow the deadline for the deliverables outlined in the SFWRENG 4G06
course outline.

\begin{table}[H]

		\hline
	\end{tabular}

	\label{project_tasks}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Planning of the Development Phases}

The development of the project will be conducted in two phases:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Initial development of application and documentation
	\item Refinement of application and documentation
\end{enumerate}

Phase 1 is where the bulk of the application will be designed and implemented. The design of both
the components of the application and how the components will interact will de developed.
Additional, Phase 1 is where most of the documentation and report will be written. Phase 1 will end
with the Revision 0 Demonstration. Here the stakeholders will see the application implementation
and be able to provide feedback.

Phase 2 will be focused on refining the application and the documentation. There is expected to be
no new major feature development and instead, all efforts will be focused on incorporating the
stakeholders' feedback into the application.

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
\subsubsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}

There are no requirements for migrating to the new product.

\subsubsection{Data That Has to Be Modified or Translated for the New System}

No data needs to be modified or translated to the new system.

\subsection{Risks}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Failures in the work orders and quotes workflow may lead to data loss.
	\item Failures in the appointments workflow may lead to a loss in appointment or conflicting
	      appointments.
	\item Failure to meet deadlines will cause setbacks in project's timeline. In the event of this, lower
	      priority requirements may need to be dropped.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Costs}

There are no financial costs associated with the development of this application. All software and
cloud infrastructure used are free to use. There will be about six months of development time
required.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
\subsubsection{User Documentation Requirements}

The application will feature a ``Getting Started'' guide, where it shall guide the user through the
most common use cases. For vehicle owners, the use cases will include: searching for shops,
requesting quotes, and scheduling appointments. For automotive shops, the use cases include:
setting shop details, managing appointments, managing employees, responding to quotes, and managing
work orders.

\subsubsection{Training Requirements}

Knowledge of how to navigate a website will be required. Documentation concerning detailed usage of
the website's user flows will be provided to the user.

\subsection{Waiting Room}

There are currently no requirements that are not part of the initial release.

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}

During the requirements collection and understanding phase, there were also ideas on how to
implement the solution.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Form
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item With the constraint that this application to be a PWA, the idea of using a React-based framework,
		            specifically Next.js.
	      \end{itemize}
	\item Authentication
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item To handle authentication, using emails and passwords, with the package NextAuth.js.
		      \item Creating a dedicated endpoint in the backend for looking up user information.
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

% 		\item Difference between physical and software constraints
% 		\item Properties of a correct solution means \emph{additional} properties, not a restating of the

% 		      constraints, then these are properties of a correct solution.
% 		\item Assumptions have to be invoked somewhere
% 		\item ``Referenced by'' implies that there is an explicit reference
% 		\item Think of traceability matrix, list of assumption invocations and list of reference by fields as
% 		      automatically generatable
% 		\item If you say the format of the output (plot, table etc), then your requirement could be more abstract
