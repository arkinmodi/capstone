\begin{itemize}
	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Technology}

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Libraries you will likely be using?
\item Tools you will likely be using?

\section{Project Scheduling}

% \wss{How will the project be scheduled?}

The project schedule will primarily follow the course calendar with development of the application
starting in October 2022. Progress of the project will be tracked using a GitHub Project board. The
deliverables due date will act as our milestones.

Decomposition of large tasks into smaller tasks for documentation deliverables will done by breaking
down the reports by section. Sections will be determined by consulting provided templates, rubrics,
and examples. Breaking large development tasks into smaller tasks will be done by first researching
and scoping out how the task should be architected. Following this initial architecture, smaller
tasks will be created.

Responsibility/ownership of tasks will be decided as a team during weekly meetings or offline
communications. It is upon each member to communicate their availability and capable workload.
Ideally, the work shall be equally distributed over the course of the project, but a shift in
workloads on an individual deliverable basis is expected. If a member is unable to complete a task
they are assigned, it is their responsibility to communicate this to the team and have the task
reassigned. The expectation is each member shall contribute an average of 10 hours per week.
