\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\section{Team Member Roles}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
	classificaiton, etc.?
\end{itemize}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Technology}

% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Specific programming language
%   \item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
%   \item Specific unit testing framework
%   \item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
%   \item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI is not being
%   done
%   \item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if appropriate
%   \item Libraries you will likely be using?
%   \item Tools you will likely be using?
% \end{itemize}

The project will written in TypeScript using the Next.js framework. Next.js is a React framework
that provides both a frontend and a backend interface. The team is comfortable with React and with
both the core Next.js team and the core React team recommending Next.js for
``production-ready projects'', we see this as a good choice. We will be using NPM as our package
manager and the packages next-auth and next-pwa. NextAuth is a package built for Next.js to quickly
enable authentication with many out of the box adaptors for providers and databases. Next-PWA is a
package to quickly enable the creating of Progressive Web App (PWA)'s in Next.js. We have decided to
create a PWA since this was one of the key application attributes that the supervisor required.

For our user interface, we have chose to use Blueprint JS as our component library along side CSS. A
team member has previous experience with this library and recommended using it.

We will be using Prisma as our ORM (Object-relational mapping) and MySQL as our database management
system. We have decided to use a SQL database due to our data having relations. MySQL was
specifically chosen due to past experience within the team. In a NoSQL database, relations are
harder to maintain and/or possibly inefficient to query. SQL databases also provide the assurances
of ACID compliance, fewer consistency issues, and enforced field constraints. The use of Prisma is
due to past experience within the team and a strong reputation within the web development world.

Jest and React Testing Library will be used for our unit tests, integration tests, and code
coverage. Most of the team does not have much experience with frontend testing, therefore we have
decided to go with the libraries recommended by Next.js. We have decided against using any
end-to-end testing frameworks (e.g., Cypress, Playwright) due to lack of domain knowledge within the
team and time constraints.

Git and GitHub will be used for version control and hosting a centralized online repository. This
was chosen due to course requirements and past experience.

Documentation will be written in a mix of \LaTeX{} and Markdown.

With high performance not being a primary goal with this project, we will not use using any
performance benchmarking tools. We will be maintaining a Google Lighthouse score of greater than
90\%.

All CI/CD pipelines will be created using GitHub Actions. This was chosen due to GitHub Actions
having great integration with GitHub, a generous free and pro tier, past experience within the team,
and ease of use.

The development environment for any developer is a highly personal decision and while we will not be
enforcing the use any specific local dev tooling, we will be recommending to all developers to use
Visual Studio Code for easy interoperability between developers. We will also have a list of
recommended extensions and setting for Visual Studio Code available in the .vscode folder. We will
also be using Docker for easy setup of external dependencies (e.g., TeX Live, MySQL).

\section{Coding Standard}

To ensure consistent code styling and code quality, the application code will be formatted using
Prettier. Prettier is an industry standard code formatter and widely agreed upon default
configuration.

For our \LaTeX{} docs, we will be using latexindent.pl. latexindent.pl is a popular \LaTeX{} code
formatter. The primary use will be for managing our whitespace to ensure consistent readability in
our source files. The primary reason behind this choice was latexindent.pl's code formatter
capabilities to automatically apply fixes.
