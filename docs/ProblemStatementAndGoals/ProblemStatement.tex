\section{Problem Statement}
This section outlines the problem, inputs and outputs, stakeholders, and environment.

\subsection{Problem}
Independent auto repair shops do not have an efficient way of reaching and interacting with new
customers. Currently, many independent shop owners rely on word-of-mouth referrals as a main
channel to acquiring new customers. Independent auto repair shops are also spending a significant
amount of their time on administrative work such as managing appointments and providing quotes. As
a result, independent auto repair shops have a difficult time competing with larger repair shops
which have dedicated systems and services in place.\\

On the other hand, customers do not have an effective way to find and compare auto repair shops.
Currently, one of the only ways to compare repair shops is by manually searching or reaching out to
repair shops one-by-one. This process can often be repetitive and time-consuming.

The purpose of this project is to create a progressive web application (PWA) to connect auto shops
with vehicle owners (customers). This project will allow independent auto repair shops and vehicle
owners to interact in a more efficient and effective manner. Vehicle owners will be able to search
for auto repair shops and services based on a variety of search filters; request quotes for
service; book, view, and manage service appointments. On the application, auto repair shop owners
will have full shop management capabilities such as: adding and managing a list of employees;
managing a list of service types and corresponding service appointment availabilities; managing
store information such as location, hours of operation, and contact information. Auto repair shop
owners and employees will be able to manage quotes, service appointments, and work orders from a
single application. Ultimately, Sayyara will significantly improve the auto repair experience for
both independent auto repair shops and vehicle owners.

\subsection{Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Vehicle owners
	\item Auto repair shop owner
	\item Auto repair shop employees
	\item Sayyara (the company)
	\item Nabeel Ibrahim (project supervisor)
	\item Tiny Coders (developers of the project)

\subsection{Environment}
\subsubsection{Hardware}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The application will be supported for desktops, laptops, tablets and mobile devices.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Software}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The application will be supported on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
	\item The application will be supported on Windows and macOS.

\end{itemize}

\section{Goals}
\subsection{Shop Management}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Allow shop owner to manage list of employees.
	\item Allow shop owner to manage shop details such as list of services, service appointment availability,
	      location, and contact details.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Work Orders}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Allow shop owners to easily create, update, view, filter, and search work orders. Work orders will
	      include any details such as estimated time, parts used, and costs related to the work order and the
	      employees assigned. This will allow shop owners and employees to see details related to the work
	      orders and update any information if needed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quotes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Allow shop owners to give efficiently quotes to customer requests. The shop owners will be able to
	      chat with the vehicle owners and respond to requests easily through the application asynchronously.
	\item Allow vehicle owners to request a quote on their job to various auto shops at once. This will allow
	      vehicle owners to easily get quotes from multiple mechanics and compare prices to find the most
	      suitable shop.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Appointments}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Allow shop owners to create, view, and edit appointments details. They can set their availability
	      on their calendar and view their scheduled appointments. This will make the booking appointment
	      process automated and reduce the amount of admin work on their end.
	\item Allow vehicle owners to search for auto shops and book an appointment at available auto shops. They
	      can select the time and date when they are available and schedule a time with an auto shop that is
	      available during that time. This will enable customers to book appointments at the selected auto
	      shop asynchronously.
\end{itemize}

\section{Stretch Goals}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Deploy application and server to the cloud.
	\item Have a notification system to notify when a quote has been requested, when appointments are created
	      or updated, and when a service job is completed/assigned to an employee.
	\item Include a reviews component to create reviews and view auto shop reviews. This way customers can
	      see past reviews before determining if they want to book an appointment with a specific shop.
	\item Include payment options for auto repair shop subscriptions. For the initial version of the
	      application, auto repair shops will not be required to enter a payment options as the application
	      will be under a free trial period.
\end{itemize}
