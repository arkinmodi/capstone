\section{Problem Statement}
This section outlines the problem, inputs and outputs, stakeholders, and environment.

\subsection{Problem}
Independent auto repair shops do not have an efficient way of reaching and interacting with new customers.
Currently, many independent shop owners rely on word-of-mouth referrals as a main channel to acquiring new customers. 
Independent auto repair shops are also spending a significant amount of their time on administrative work such as 
managing appointments and providing quotes. As a result, independent auto repair shops have a difficult time 
competing with larger repair shops which have dedicated systems and services in place.\\

On the other hand, customers do not have an effective way to find and compare auto repair shops. 
Currently, one of the only ways to compare repair shops is by manually searching or reaching out to repair shops one-by-one. 
This process can often be repetitive and time-consuming.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}
\subsubsection{Inputs}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Auto repair shop account details including shop name, shop owner first and last name, address, phone number, email, password, and hours of operation

    \item Schedule of availability for auto repair shops
    \item Quote request details including car make and model, problem description, images
    \item Selected time slot for service appointments
    \item Estimate information including price and estimated time
    \item Work order information including estimated time, progress, parts used, cost of labour and parts
    \item Chat messages between auto repair shop and customers

    \item Customer's location for searching and filtering for nearby auto repair shops
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Outputs}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item View of appointments booked for shop owners
    \item View of quote request for shop owners
    \item View of appointments booked for customers
    \item View of quote request submitted for customers
    \item List of auto repair shops based on search keywords and filters inputted by customers
    \item View of work orders and corresponding details for shop owners
    \item View of work orders, corresponding details, and progress updates for customer
    \item Chat view for both shop owners and customers
    \item {[Stretch Goal]} Notifications to auto repair shops when a quote request is received
    \item {[Stretch Goal]} Notifications to vehicle owners when a quote is received, work is completed/assigned, 
    or an appointment has been created or updated
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Vehicle owners
    \item Auto repair shop owner
    \item Auto repair shop employees
    \item Sayyara (the company)
    \item Nabeel Ibrahim (project supervisor)
    \item Tiny Coders (developers of the project)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Environment}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The application will be supported for desktops, laptops, tablets and mobile devices.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Software}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The application will be supported on Google Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.
    \item The application will be supported on Windows and MacOS.
    \item The application will be supported on Android and iOS mobile devices and tablets.
\end{itemize}

\section{Goals}
\subsection{Work Orders}
\begin{itemize}
\item Allow shop owners to easily create, update, view, filter, and search work orders. Work orders will include any details such as estimated time, parts used, and costs related to the work order and the technican assigned. This will allow shop owners and technicians to see details related to the work orders and update any information if needed. The shop owner can also send work order receipts to the customer and request payment when the order is completed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quotes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Allow shop owners to give efficiently quotes to customer requests. The shop owners will be able to chat with the vehicle owners and respond to requests easily through the application asynchronously.
    \item Allow vehicle owners to request a quote on their job to various auto shops at once. This will allow vehicle owners to easily get quotes from multiple mechanics and compare prices to find the most suitable shop.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Appointments}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Allow shop owners to create, view, and edit appointments details. They can set their availability on their calendar and view their scheduled appointments. This will make the booking appointment process automated and reduce the amount of admin work on their end.
    \item Allow vehicle owners to search for auto shops and book an appointment at available auto shops. They can select the time and date when they are available and schedule a time with an auto shop that is available during that time. This will enable customers to book appointments at the selected auto shop asynchronously.
\end{itemize}

\section{Stretch Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Deploy application and server to the cloud.
    \item Have a notification system to notify when a quote has been requested, when appointments are created or updated, and when a service job is completed/assigned to a technician.
    \item Include a reviews component to create reviews and view auto shop reviews. This way customers can see past reviews before determining if they want to book an appointment with a specific shop.
\end{itemize}
