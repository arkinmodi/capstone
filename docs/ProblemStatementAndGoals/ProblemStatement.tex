\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the
\href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/main/docs/Checklists/ProbState-Checklist.pdf}
{problem statement checklist}.}
\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required information.}

\subsection{Problem}
Independent mechanics at auto repair shops don't have an efficient way of reaching new customers, scheduling appointments with customers, and giving quotes. The problem occurs for the customers as well. Auto repair shop customers are looking for an efficient and effective way to compare mechanics, get quotes on their auto repairs and easily schedule appointments at auto shops.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\subsection{Stakeholders}
- Automobile owners
- Independent shop mechanics

\section{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
\subsection{Work Orders}
\item Shop owners can create, update, view, filter, search work orders. Any details such as estimated time, parts used, and costs related to the work order and showing the technican assigned to each order. Allow the shop owner to send work order receipts to the customer and request payment.
\subsection{Quotes}
\item Shop owners can give quotes to customer requests. The shop owners will be able to chat with the vehicle owners and respond to requests easily through the application.
\item Vechicle owners can request a quote on their job. This will allow vehicle owners to easily get quotes from multiple mechanics and compare prices.
\subsection{Appointments}
\item Shop owners can create, view, edit appointments. Shop owners can set their availability on their calendar and view appointments scheduled.
\item Vehicle owners can search for auto shops and book an appointment at available auto shops. They can select the time and date when they are available and schedule a time with an auto shop that is available during that time.
\end{itemize}
