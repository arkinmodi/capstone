\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the

{problem statement checklist}.}
\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required information.}

\subsection{Problem}
Independent auto repair shops do not have an efficient way of reaching and interacting with new customers.
Currently, many independent shop owners rely on word-of-mouth referrals as a main channel to acquiring new customers. 
Independent auto repair shops are also spending a significant amount of their time on administrative work such as 
managing appointments and providing quotes. As a result, independent auto repair shops have a difficult time 
competing with larger repair shops which have dedicated systems and services in place.\\

On the other hand, customers do not have an effective way to find and compare auto repair shops. 
Currently, one of the only ways to compare repair shops is by manually searching or reaching out to repair shops one-by-one. 
This process can often be repetitive and time-consuming.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}
