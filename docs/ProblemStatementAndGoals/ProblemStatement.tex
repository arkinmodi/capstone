\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the
\href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/main/docs/Checklists/ProbState-Checklist.pdf}
{problem statement checklist}.}
\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required information.}

\subsection{Problem}
Independent auto repair shops do not have an efficient way of reaching and interacting with new customers.
Currently, many independent shop owners rely on word-of-mouth referrals as a main channel to acquiring new customers. 
Independent auto repair shops are also spending a significant amount of their time on administrative work such as 
managing appointments and providing quotes. As a result, independent auto repair shops have a difficult time 
competing with larger repair shops which have dedicated systems and services in place.\\

On the other hand, customers do not have an effective way to find and compare auto repair shops. 
Currently, one of the only ways to compare repair shops is by manually searching or reaching out to repair shops one-by-one. 
This process can often be repetitive and time-consuming.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\section{Goals}
\subsection{Work Orders}
\begin{itemize}
\item Shop owners can create, update, view, filter, search work orders. Work orders will include any details such as estimated time, parts used, and costs related to the work order and the technican assigned. This will allow shop owners and technicians to see details related to the work orders and update any information if needed. The shop owner can also send work order receipts to the customer and request payment when the order is completed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quotes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Shop owners can give quotes to customer requests. The shop owners will be able to chat with the vehicle owners and respond to requests easily through the application asynchronously.
\item Vehicle owners can request a quote on their job. This will allow vehicle owners to easily get quotes from multiple mechanics and compare prices to find the most suitable shop.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Appointments}
\begin{itemize}
\item Shop owners can create, view, and edit appointments. They can set their availability on their calendar and view their scheduled appointments making the booking appointment process automated and reduce the amount of admin work on their end.
\item Vehicle owners can search for auto shops and book an appointment at available auto shops. They can select the time and date when they are available and schedule a time with an auto shop that is available during that time. This will enable customers to book appointments at the auto shop asynchronously.
\end{itemize}
