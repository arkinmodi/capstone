\section{Introduction}
This document outlines the hazard analysis of Sayyara. The definition of hazard is any property or
condition in the system along with conditions in the environment that may cause harm or damage.
This definition is from Nancy Leveson's work. The hazards for Sayyara include security and usage
hazards such as protecting personal information, database failures, and having no internet
connection.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}
The scope of the hazard analysis is to identify any hazards that may arise when using the
application, their causes, coming up with steps to eliminate or mitigate the effect of the hazard.
The purpose of the hazard analysis is to pinpoint areas where hazards may arise and their effects
and come up with mitigation steps. Through completing the hazard analysis, safety and security
requirements will be developed early in the design process to minimize the risk of having hazards
occur without plans in place to reduce or mitigate the effects.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}
The system consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The application's front-end and back-end components in the major categories:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Authentication
		      \item Appointments
		      \item Quotes
		      \item Work Orders
		      \item Shop Profile
		      \item Services
		      \item Shop Employees
	      \end{itemize}
	\item The database being used which will store all of application's data
\end{enumerate}

\section{Critical Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Assume the users of the application are not intentionally trying to misuse it
	\item Assume that the user will follow cybersecurity best practices
\end{itemize}
