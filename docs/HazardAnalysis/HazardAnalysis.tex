\section{Introduction}
This document outlines the hazard analysis of Sayyara. The definition of hazard is any property or
condition in the system along with conditions in the environment that may cause harm or damage.
This definition is from Nancy Leveson's work. The hazards for Sayyara include security and usage
hazards such as protecting personal information, database failures, and having no internet
connection.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}
The scope of the hazard analysis is to identify any hazards that may arise when using the
application, their causes, coming up with steps to eliminate or mitigate the effect of the hazard.
The purpose of the hazard analysis is to pinpoint areas where hazards may arise and their effects
and come up with mitigation steps. Through completing the hazard analysis, safety and security
requirements will be developed early in the design process to minimize the risk of having hazards
occur without plans in place to reduce or mitigate the effects.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}
The system consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The application's frontend and backend components in the major categories:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Authentication
		      \item Appointments
		      \item Quotes
		      \item Work Orders
		      \item Shop Profile
		      \item Services
		      \item Shop Employees
	      \end{itemize}
	\item The database being used which will store all of application's data
\end{enumerate}

\section{Critical Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Assume the users of the application are not intentionally trying to misuse it
	\item Assume that the user will follow cybersecurity best practices
\end{itemize}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[label=SR\arabic*.]
	\item The system shall protect personally identifiable information (PII) by encrypting information both
	      at rest and in transit
	\item[] \emph{Rationale:} There are legal consequences associated with losing people's PPI.
	\item[] \emph{Associated Hazards:} H1-1 \\

	\item The system shall allow the user to reset their password
	\item[] \emph{Rationale:} If a user forgets their password, they will be unable to access information
		regarding their work. Furthermore, losing access to their account due to a malicious actor would
		allow unauthorized people access to components that require a level of authorization.
	\item[] \emph{Associated Hazards:} H2-1, H2-2 \\

	\item The system shall allow the shop owner or employee to accept appointments before they are finalized
	\item[] \emph{Rationale:} As the application is run in real time with multiple users, scheduling conflicts
		can occur if multiple users fill in a time slot at the same time. Allowing the shop owner or employees
		to accept would remove the hazard of conflicting schedules.
	\item[] \emph{Associated Hazards:} H3-1 \\

	\item The system shall notify the user if there is no network connection
	\item[] \emph{Rationale:} A connection cannot be made to the application if there is no network connection.
		Letting the user know that they have no connection would help prevent any hazards.
	\item[] \emph{Associated Hazards:} H4-1, H7-1, H7-2 \\

	\item The system shall cache recent chat messages
	\item[] \emph{Rationale:} Caching recent chat messages allows the user to keep reading their conversations,
		even without access to a network.
	\item[] \emph{Associated Hazards:} H4-1 \\

	\item The system shall take periodic backups and snapshots of the database and allow shop owners to
	      request rollbacks
	\item[] \emph{Rationale:} It would be catastrophic to lose critical data in the case of a database failure.
		Having backups and snapshots would alleviate this hazard.
	\item[] \emph{Associated Hazards:} H5-1, H5-2, H6-1, H7-1, H7-2, H8-2 \\

	\item The system shall disable invite links to employees after they have been used, after a set period of
	      time, or if the shop owner revokes access
	\item[] \emph{Rationale:} Having an invite link stay after its intended duration would cause problems, such
		as accidentally allowing former employees back into the shop.
	\item[] \emph{Associated Hazards:} H8-1 \\

	\item The system shall allow multiple invite links to a single employee, though only one invite link can
	      be valid at any given time
	\item[] \emph{Rationale:} There could be a situation where a database failure, or human error cause an
		employee to be unable to accept their first invitation. Allowing multiple invite links to the same
		employee would resolve this hazard. Allowing only one valid link at any time would prevent malicious
		actors from using links that were not meant to be used.
	\item[] \emph{Associated Hazards:} H8-2 \\
\end{enumerate}

% \wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
% 	rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

The hazard analysis has identified a number of safety and security requirements that will need to
be met by this application. Due to time constraints, not all of these requirements will be
fulfilled before the Revision 1 deadline in April 2023. The following requirements have been
identified as higher priority as well as feasible within the time constraints and shall be
completed within the initial timeline of the project: SR1, SR2, SR3, SR4.
